Klipper is a 3d-Printer firmware. It combines the power of a general
purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use Klipper.

To begin using Klipper start by
[installing](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html) it.

Klipper is Free Software. See the [license](COPYING) or read the
[documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). We depend on
the generous support from our
[sponsors](https://www.klipper3d.org/Sponsors.html).

Note: this version is a fork to support the TenLog TL-D3 Pro IDEX printer,
and is based upon work from 
[jonpackard](https://github.com/jonpackard/klipper_config_tld3pro) 
and from 
[matti125](https://github.com/matti125/klipper_config)

as well as the Marlin 1 source from  TenLog.
